The goal is to study the message propagation delay distribution, and how it\'s affected by i) rln and ii) message size in a real environment. We observe that for messages of 10kB the average end-to-end propagation delay is 508 ms. We can also observe that the message propagation delays are severely affected when increasing the message size, which indicates that it is not a good idea to use waku for messages of eg. 500kB.
