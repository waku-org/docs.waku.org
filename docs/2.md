Waku v1 was a fork of Whisper with some added tweaks for efficiency.
Waku v2 is a completely redesigned suite of protocols designed to address the goals set out [previously](./1.md).

### 2013

Ethereum White Paper was introduced with the Holy Trinity,
consisting of Ethereum for consensus, Swarm for decentralized storage, and Whisper for p2p messaging.

### 2015-2018

R&D of Whisper was slow to follow progress of the Ethereum EVM and Swarm without a dedicated team building out the protocol.

### 2018

With little progress made on Whisper and significant scalability concerns growing,
Vac was formed to conduct R&D on more scalable p2p messaging.

### 2020

Waku v1 was introduced as the messaging protocol in Status, replacing Whisper.

### 2021

Waku v2 replaces Waku v1.
