## What isnâ€™t Waku?

- Waku is not a blockchain but a network composed of protocols designed for Web3 communication, operating without the need for gas fees.
- Waku is not just for messaging applications; it supports the development of complex applications that require secure and private data transmission.
- Waku is not a long-term data storage network; it focuses on short, ephemeral, real-time messaging.

## What can Waku be used for?

1. **Chat Messengers**: Waku can be used to build private, decentralised chat apps resistant to censorship.
2. **Voting and Proposals**: Exchange votes on proposals off-chain via Waku to save gas fees, then submit aggregated results to the blockchain.
3. **NFT Marketplaces**: Use Waku to handle off-chain NFT bids and offers for gas savings, and to integrate social interactions like likes and comments.
4. **State Channels**: Establish and maintain state channels with Waku, facilitating seamless message exchanges and updates without blockchain interaction.
5. **Signature Exchange for Multi-Signature Wallets**: Allow multi-signature wallet owners to exchange signatures privately and securely through Waku.
6. **Game Mechanics Communication**: Implement Waku as a communication layer for decentralised, peer-to-peer gaming, avoiding centralised infrastructure.
7. **Layer 2 Coordination (Open Market, Spam Protected Mempool)**: Broadcast and aggregate Layer 2 transactions via Waku to enhance privacy and scalability, reducing network load.
8. **Social Media Platforms**: Beyond chat messengers, use Waku for decentralised, censorship-resistant social media platforms like news feeds and multimedia sharing.
