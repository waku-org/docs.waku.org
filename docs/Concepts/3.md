title: Protocols Overview by Example
---

We have six nodes, A-F.

The protocols initially mounted are indicated as such.

![protocol overview](../../static//sequnce-charts/protocols-overview/overview.png "Protocols Overview")

The PubSub topic `pubtopic1` is used for routing (the network uses a default pubsub topic, [click here more info](notion://www.notion.so/2.md)) and indicates that it is subscribed to messages on that topic for relay.Ditto for Waku Store where it indicates that these messages are persisted on that node.

1. Node A creates a WakuMessage `msg1` with a ContentTopic `/my-dapp/0/notifications/proto`.

2. Node F requests to get messages filtered by PubSub topic `pubtopic1` and ContentTopic `contentTopic1`. Node D subscribes F to this filter and will in the future forward messages that match that filter.

3. Node A publishes `msg1` on `pubtopic1` and subscribes to that relay topic pick it up. It then gets relayed further from B to D, but not C since it doesn't subscribe to that topic.

4. Node D saves `msg1` for possible later retrieval by other nodes.

5. Node D also pushes `msg1` to F, as it has previously subscribed F to this filter.

6. At a later time, Node E comes online. It then requests messages matching `pubtopic1` and `contentTopic1` from Node D. Node D responds with messages meeting this (and possibly other) criteria.
