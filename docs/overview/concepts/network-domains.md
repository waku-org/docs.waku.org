title: Network Domains
---

Waku is a unified and cohesive entity that offers a rich ecosystem with three distinct network interaction domains. These domains serve specialised purposes and contribute to the robust functionality of Waku, forming its foundation.

## Discovery Domain

Peer discovery in Waku facilitates locating other nodes within the network. As a modular protocol, Waku incorporates various discovery mechanisms, such as [Discv5](/overview/concepts/discv5) and [Peer Exchange](/overview/concepts/peer-exchange). These mechanisms allow developers to choose the most suitable option(s) for their specific use cases and user environments, including mobile phones, desktop browsers, servers, and more.

## Gossip Domain

GossipSub derives its name from the practice within Pub/Sub networks where peers gossip about the messages they have encountered, thus establishing a message delivery network.

Waku employs gossiping through [Relay](/overview/concepts/protocols#relay) to distribute messages across the network. Additionally, Waku introduces [RLN Relay](/overview/concepts/protocols#rln-relay), an experimental mechanism that combines privacy preservation and economic spam protection.

## Request/Response Domain

Waku provides a set of protocols to optimise its performance in resource-limited environments like low bandwidth or mostly offline scenarios for multiple purposes.

- [Store](/overview/concepts/protocols#store) enables the retrieval of historical messages.
- [Filter](/overview/concepts/protocols#filter) efficiently retrieves a subset of messages to conserve bandwidth.
- [Light Push](/overview/concepts/protocols#light-push) facilitates message publication for nodes with limited bandwidth and short connection windows.

## Overview of Protocol Interaction

Here is a diagram illustrating the interaction between different protocols within the Waku Network.
