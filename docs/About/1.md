Waku (v2) is family of modular peer-to-peer protocols for **secure communication**. The protocols are designed to be secure, privacy-preserving, censorship-resistant and able to run in resource restricted environments.

It enables you to **add communication features** to your dApp in a **decentralized manner**,
ensuring to your users that they will not be censored or de-platformed.

- **removes centralized third parties from messaging**: enabling private, secure, censorship-free communication with no single point of failure.
- provides **privacy-preserving capabilities**: sender anonymity, metadata protection and unlinkability to personally identifiable information.
- designed for **generalized messaging**: enables human-to-human, machine-to-machine or hybrid communication.
- **runs everywhere**: desktop, server, including resource-restricted devices, such as mobile devices and browsers.
