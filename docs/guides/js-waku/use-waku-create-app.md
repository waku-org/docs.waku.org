title: "Bootstrap DApps Using @waku/create-app"
---

This guide provides detailed steps to bootstrap your next `@waku/sdk` project from [various example templates](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku-examples/tree/master/examples) using the [@waku/create-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@waku/create-app) package.

## Usage

Initialise a new `@waku/sdk` template using any of the following methods:

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```shell
npx @waku/create-app [PROJECT DIRECTORY]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```shell
yarn create @waku/app [PROJECT DIRECTORY]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, select a template to initialise your app from:

:::tip
If you have previously installed `@waku/create-app` globally, we recommend uninstalling the package to ensure that `npx` always uses the latest version.
