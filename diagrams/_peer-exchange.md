1. DNS Discovery protocol is executed.
2. Alice retrieves Bob's websocket multiaddr from DNS Server.

4. Alice executes a Peer Exchange query to Bob.
5. Bob returns Carol's and David's ENR to Alice.
6. Alice decodes ENRs and extracts Carol's and David's websocket multiaddrs.
7. Alice dials Carol and David.
